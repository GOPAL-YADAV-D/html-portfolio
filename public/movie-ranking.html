<h1> Movies and Series watched and to be watched by Gopal </h1>

<h2> All time favourite </h2>
<hr />
<h3> Chernobyl </h3>
<p>
This is a HBO mini series based on true events,<br />
about the chernobyl nuclear disaster ( first nuclear disaster ) which happened in 1984 ,<br />
in chernobyl in the pripyat powert plant in sovit union 
</p>

<h3> Sherlock Holmes </h3>

<p>
    As the name suggests the movie is about the adventures of sherlock holmes ,<br />
    but what makes this movies different from the other sherlock movies or series is the acting by non other than Mr.Robert Downey Junior <br />
</p>

<h3> Marvel movies ( Iron man 1 - End Game ) </h3>

<p>
    These movies have been a big part of my life as growing up as a kid who doesn't like superheroes .<br />
    If you ask me why i stopped watching the franchise ,it is majorly due to my favourite character dying ( iron man ) and also due to crowding the superhero scene.

<h3> Oppenhimer </h3>

<p> 
    After watching chernobyl I really became hooked to the topic of nucler .<br />
    Being able to watch the naration about the first nuclear test and that to directed by Sir Christopher Nolen is a cherry to top it of .
